# Learn-Python-Obstacle-Course
This is a program that runs users through the basics of learning Python. The program collects data along the way. Once I had enough data collected from the obstacle course, I put the data into a Machine Learning Algorithm using the MLP Classifier. 
The target audience for this "Python Learning Obstacle Course" is youth and teen students who want to learn how to program. 
Learning with an obstacle course / interactive game is more fun than learning from a textbook and with examples/labs.
Plus, this obstacle course offers a challenge. You are trying to beat the clock! 
I collected sample data on how long it took the user to complete an obstacle, how many times the user failed, how many times the user had to input, and the particular obstacle number.
In order to collect sample data, I used a group of people who I thought would think most like kids, anxious sleep-deprived college students. 
The Artificial Intelligence component comes into play because I took all of my sample data and created a Machine Learning Algorithm where the algorithm would guess which Obstacle was completed based on a set of inputs. 
Then, once the algorithm guesses the obstacle, the AI-bot gives the answer to that particular obstacle. 
Learning with interactive and competitive simulations makes learning more appealing.
